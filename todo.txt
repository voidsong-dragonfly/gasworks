 - Compost pile features
     - Possibly change recipe maps for composting recipes?
     - Possibly a compost crafting recipe (dirt + total 1 compost chance)
 - Sluice
     - Rightclick with water container in main hand and with block in the offhand
     - Possibly a special item for filling the sluice with water? Water bowl, plus SIN agrees. Water bowl used for crafting stews.
     - Two states for the sluice: empty & full. Full requires a rightclick with a shovel to remove sediment.
     - Have types for gravel at the top (guaranteed) and then choice of types for the bottom? Sand, red sand, mud?
     - Should I bother with custom recipes at all? Depends if I want to bother with custom output or not.
     - SIN suggests to put off a BER for now and to have it as a later, more complex feature
 - Other tier 0 features
     - Prospector's Pick

     - Two kinds of durability, 'minor fixes' & 'major fixes'
 - Enchanting system
     - Books stacked; used for journals as well as normal books
     - Refactor enchanting power to depend on a much larger library & actual accessibility system
     - Bias enchantments via journals of skill (invested levels)
     - Other things like Anvil can use the library system to decrease costs
 - prevent the player from breaking blocks without tools
     - possibly use Player#blockActionRestricted & restrict to hardness 0.3 or under broken w/o tool?
     - would need to add tools for beacon, piston head (?) (axe?), honeycomb (axe?), frosted ice (pick?), cactus (axe?), glowstone (pick?)
     - Would need exceptions for some tool-less blocks (eggs, heads?)
     - Can use PlayerEvent.BreakSpeed event as it is cancellable
 - flour & some minor food tweaks
     - FD compat: rice flour, dough from them for bread, etc
     - other mod compat maybe?
     - create flour in the crafting grid for now?

     - Drop coral/dead coral down to match other similar stones?
     - Bump colored concrete to match theoretical final concrete? 1.5/10?

     - possibly reduce cake hardness to 0.2 or 0.3? unsure...

     - later game, torches can be crafted in the workbench with a lot of sticks, some wool, and a bucket of creosote/coal tar
     - if I ever add soul oil, soul torches can be crafted via the same method as 4 but with soul oil

next focus:
 - tweaks to recovery compasses
 - quiver & barometer
