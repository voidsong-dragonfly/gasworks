 - Compost pile features
     - Possibly change recipe maps for composting recipes?
     - Possibly a compost crafting recipe (dirt + total 1 compost chance)
 - Other tier 0 features
     - Prospector's Pick
     - Mineral lodes
     - Trip hammer
     - Machine shop 0/workshop system
         - Each machine can be used independently, though some may not have uses
         - Workshop itself is interacted with through a 'workshop bench' or 'workshop table'
             - Three types of workshops: Machine Shop (Technology), Tool Forge (Tool Repair & Crafting), and Library (Enchanting)
             - "Tier -1 machine shop" tasks can be done directly at the Shaping Anvil
             - workshop manifest system (?) - do we care for tool forge? would need lecterns in some places, possibly, or some other method of storing manifests
             - library manifest system is the most fleshed out at the moment
         - Some types of workshops can coexist (machine shop, tool forge), others cannot (machine shop/tool forge, library)
         - Several kinds of actions that the workshops shop can provide: Hammer, Grind, Cut, Turn, Assemble, Heat, Forge, Mill

             - Heat:       T0: Forge Hearth,    T1: Gas Hearth,    T2:  N/A, T3: Soulfire Furnace
            ---------  NOT IN MACHINE-SHOP  ---------
             - Forge:      T0: Redstone Hammer, T1: Steam Hammer,  T2+: N/A
             - Knowledge:  (other mechanics)
     - Crude Blast Furnace & bellows
     - Kiln
     - Turntable for blocks that need mechanical power (Geared Hammer, Geared Bellows)
     - Implement jute, hemp, & possibly rubber?
 - possible features i might like from Suppl
     - Ash from burning blocks => decide if I want to entirely redo fire spread first
     - Useful small blocks; turntable, adjustable lever, & wind vane?
     - Feeding & nesting blocks to help with automation
     - Fabric blocks such as awnings, bales, etc
     - Map icons for portals, beacons, etc?
 - Tool system
     - Two kinds of durability, 'minor fixes' & 'major fixes'
         - Minor fixes can be repaired with N nuggets of the material each time, and can be fixed out in the wild via a maintenance kit
         - Minor fixes simply increase tool stats back to the default, as they slowly wear down over time
         - Major breaks mean you lose the tool, but they are telegraphed. these repairs need the entire cost of the tool to fix.
     - Enchanted tools are different than normal tools: they can't be majorly repaired normally
         - Enchanted tools also cost more resources and some experience to minorly repair, scaling with the number of repairs
             - This scaling is much less than the standard Vanilla scaling
             - This scaling persists even if the tool is fully repaired with Mending
         - Enchanting a tool with mending will allow it to be fully repaired once, which will strip mending off again
         - Enchanted tools shatter into EXP when broken somehow, either literally or as some sort of item
     - Tool speed is increased significantly to make progressing into later tool tiers more beneficial
     - Efficiency now reduces the breaking speed of harder to break blocks, doing nothing to blocks below a certain speed threshold
     - Efficiency is incompatible with unbreaking
     - Unbreaking now prevents the tool from shattering at zero durability, but does nothing to durability
     - Figure out how this applies to the following pseudo-tools:
         - Fishing Rod  | Barely a tool, can't be material-repaired, move from anvil to workbench
         - Shears       | Metal tool, standard DualDurabilityTool (changes, factor out into Item and Tool ?)
         - Mace         | Can be repaired, is repaired by breeze rods. Unsure what a second "sharpness" dura would mean
         - Shield       | Standard durability, modify to not allow repairing in the anvil & instead process via workbench
         - Trident      | (?)
         - Bow          | Barely a tool, can't be material-repaired, move from anvil to workbench
         - Crossbow     | Barely a tool, can't be material-repaired, move from anvil to workbench
         - Brush        | Barely a tool, can't be material-repaired, move from anvil to workbench
     - Deal with RepairItemRecipe somehow: delete, modify, blacklist, etc
     - Deal with Grindstome somehow:
     - Figure out how to work with armor
         - Will need a custom ArmorMaterial
         - May want both chain & non-chain variants of armor? Unsure. Would be up to 7 armor types tho...
         - Crafting recipes should include leather/fabric; less for non-leather armors
         - May want to degrade protection down towards 50% or so with more minor damage. definitely not zero at low tho.
         - Want slowdowns from some armors? Minor but can be resolved with less protection? Some other benefit?
         - Currently, chain basically doesn't have a use, that's not great...
 - Enchanting system
     - Books stacked; used for journals as well as normal books
     - Refactor enchanting power to depend on a much larger library & actual accessibility system
     - Bias enchantments via treatises of <x> (invested levels)
         - PROTECTION, UTILITY, DAMAGE, SCAVENGING, ELEMENTAL_AFFINITY, MOVEMENT, TREASURE
         - DAMAGE: Sharpness, Smite, Bane of Arth, Power, Thorns, Sweeping Edge, Density                 | skull (any), dragon's breath, firework star
         - UTILITY: Silk Touch, Lure, Respiration, Efficiency, Loyalty, Infinity, Quick Charge           | spyglass, barometer, shulker box, name tag,
         - SCAVENGING: Luck of the Sea, Fortune, Looting, Prospector, Archaeologist's Touch, Multishot   | amethyst cluster/shard, diamond, emerald, ancient debris/scrap,
         - PROTECTION: Prot, Fire Prot, Blast Prot, Proj. Prot, Magic. Prot, Breach                      | shulker shell, turtle scute, armadillo scute, horse armor, end crystal, totem of undying
         - MOVEMENT: Depth Strider, Riptide, Anchoring, Knockback, Punch, Lunge, Feather Fall            | wind charge, eye of ender, elytra, saddle,
         - ELEMENTAL_AFFINITY: Channeling, Flame, Fire Aspect, Aqua Affinity, Frost Aspect, Impaling     | heart of the sea, nautilus shell, prismarine (etc), breeze rod, blaze rod, blaze powder
         - TREASURE: Frost Walker, Mending, Soul Speed, Swift Sneak, Wind Burst                          | heart of the sea, heavy core, gilded blackstone, echo shard, music disc
         - minimum experience: 30L, cost: 1 30L tome, 3L player experience with catalyst (unconsumed), 10L without (?)
         - need to decide if catalysts are a viable system with enough interesting & unique items (?)
     - considering a 'library catalogue' system to give more use to lecterns
         - on a lectern in the 8 blocks surrounding the enchantment table, need a "library catalogue" book
         - library catalogue stores the location of all of the bookshelves linked to this table
         - check access on each time, same as usual. no raycasts, all we check is block & then access from floor
         - 11 distance each access maximum for bookshelves from enchantment table
         - check for bookshelves (tag, `c:bookshelves`), chiseled bookshelves (by extends it), and Gasworks book piles
         - each enchanted book in the local area (chiseled bookshelves, piles) decreases difference between levels and points costed by 5%
         - Treatise on <x> is how you bias the enchantments, only need one. Treatise on local lectern has priority, other nearby treatises bias next enchants
      - enchantment combination is no longer done through the anvil, it is instead the domain of the scribe's workbench
         - takes a lectern nearby with library manifest same as the enchanting table does
         - library manifest reduces costs considerably for prior-work penalties
         - redo prior-work penalties to make it dependent only on enchantments rather than order (?)
         -
 - prevent the player from breaking blocks without tools
     - possibly use Player#blockActionRestricted & restrict to hardness 0.3 or under broken w/o tool?
     - would need to add tools for beacon, piston head (?) (axe?), honeycomb (axe?), frosted ice (pick?), cactus (axe?), glowstone (pick?)
     - Would need exceptions for some tool-less blocks (eggs, heads?)
     - Can use PlayerEvent.BreakSpeed event as it is cancellable
 - flour & some minor food tweaks
     - FD compat: rice flour, dough from them for bread, etc
     - other mod compat maybe?
     - create flour in the crafting grid for now?
 - less important/strange hardness tweaks for some blocks
     - Drop coral/dead coral down to match other similar stones?
     - Bump colored concrete to match theoretical final concrete? 1.5/10?
     - Bump glazed terracotta up to normal terracotta?
     - possibly reduce cake hardness to 0.2 or 0.3? unsure...
     - possibly increase bed hardness from 0.2? unsure...
 - Crafting tweaks to mudbrick? Add literal mud bricks?
 - finish updating torch tweaks
     - later game, torches can be crafted in the workbench with a lot of sticks, some wool, and a bucket of creosote/coal tar
     - if I ever add soul oil, soul torches can be crafted via the same method as 4 but with soul oil
 - add damage to some more blocks that should have it?
     - stonecutter
 - fix mob UI of the issue of walking into shit (?)
     - needs to be coupled with the above to make sure villagers don't suicide themselves
 - explosive tweaks to TNT and the addition of gunpowder placement/gunpowder barrels
     - Port gunpowder barrels from IE to GS
     - add in lines of gunpowder being able to trigger barrels/TNT
     - change the name of TNT perhaps?
 - crates (?)
 - Weatherproofed Planks/wood/etc
 - figure out fireclay/nether brick debate I started having in my head recently
     - do we care about having limeclay specifically, and not using nether resources (?)
     - nether clay makes nether bricks, netherrack used as flux alongside dripstone or calcite
     - minecraft clay is very kaolinite-colored, but still fires to the classic red brick. how much do we care?
     - compat issues with other mods, or the lack thereof
     - how well does this stuff fit in progression? => pretty well. crude BF uses normal bricks, kiln and normal use nether brick
     - get nether brick after crude BF which allows building a better BF as well as boilers (?)
     - will need to keep limeclay around for ironmaking in the overworld. instead just normal clay + dripstone (!) or possibly calcite (!)
     - will need a way to get that's not standard deposits, suggest keeping ore deposit for now, but on surface. clay pit perhaps (?)
     - do we care if we use nether clay at all, or can we keep the current method? => finding nether clay, etc
