 - Compost pile features
     - Possibly change recipe maps for composting recipes?
     - Possibly a compost crafting recipe (dirt + total 1 compost chance)
 - Sluice
     - Rightclick with water container in main hand and with block in the offhand
     - Possibly a special item for filling the sluice with water? Water bowl, plus SIN agrees. Water bowl used for crafting stews.
     - Two states for the sluice: empty & full. Full requires a rightclick with a shovel to remove sediment.
     - Have types for gravel at the top (guaranteed) and then choice of types for the bottom? Sand, red sand, mud?
     - Should I bother with custom recipes at all? Depends if I want to bother with custom output or not.
     - SIN suggests to put off a BER for now and to have it as a later, more complex feature
 - Other tier 0 features
     - Prospector's Pick
     - Mineral lodes
     - Trip hammer
     - Machine shop 0/workshop system
         - Each machine can be used independently, though some may not have uses
         - Workshop itself is interacted with through a 'workshop bench' or 'workshop table'
             - Three types of workshops: Machine Shop (Technology), Tool Forge (Tool Repair & Crafting), and Library (Enchanting)
             - "Tier -1 machine shop" tasks can be done directly at the Shaping Anvil
         - Some types of workshops can coexist (machine shop, tool forge), others cannot (machine shop/tool forge, library)
         - Several kinds of actions that the workshops shop can provide: Hammer, Grind, Cut, Turn, Assemble, Heat, Forge, Mill

             - Forge:      T0: Redstone Hammer, T1: Steam Hammer,  T2+: N/A
             - Knowledge:  (other mechanics)
     - Crude Blast Furnace & bellows
     - Kiln
     - Crude mechanical power
     - Implement jute, hemp, & possibly rubber?
 - possible features i might like from Suppl
     - Ash from burning blocks => decide if I want to entirely redo fire spread first
     - Useful small blocks; turntable, adjustable lever, & wind vane?
     - Feeding & nesting blocks to help with automation
     - Fabric blocks such as awnings, bales, etc
     - Map icons for portals, beacons, etc?
 - Tool system
     - Two kinds of durability, 'minor fixes' & 'major fixes'
         - Minor fixes can be repaired with N nuggets of the material each time, and can be fixed out in the wild via a maintenance kit
         - Minor fixes simply increase tool stats back to the default, as they slowly wear down over time
         - Major breaks mean you lose the tool, but they are telegraphed. these repairs need the entire cost of the tool to fix.
     - Enchanted tools are different than normal tools: they can't be majorly repaired normally
         - Enchanted tools also cost more resources and some experience to minorly repair, scaling with the number of repairs
             - This scaling is much less than the standard Vanilla scaling
             - This scaling persists even if the tool is fully repaired with Mending
         - Enchanting a tool with mending will allow it to be fully repaired once, which will strip mending off again
         - Enchanted tools shatter into EXP when broken somehow, either literally or as some sort of item
     - Tool speed is increased significantly to make progressing into later tool tiers more beneficial
     - Efficiency now reduces the breaking speed of harder to break blocks, doing nothing to blocks below a certain speed threshold
     - Efficiency is incompatible with unbreaking
     - Unbreaking now prevents the tool from shattering at zero durability, but does nothing to durability
     - Figure out how this applies to the following pseudo-tools:
         - Fishing Rod  | Barely a tool, can't be material-repaired, move from anvil to workbench
         - Shears       | Metal tool, standard DualDurabilityTool (changes, factor out into Item and Tool ?)
         - Mace         | Can be repaired, is repaired by breeze rods. Unsure what a second "sharpness" dura would mean
         - Shield       | Standard durability, modify to not allow repairing in the anvil & instead process via workbench
         - Trident      | (?)
         - Bow          | Barely a tool, can't be material-repaired, move from anvil to workbench
         - Crossbow     | Barely a tool, can't be material-repaired, move from anvil to workbench
         - Brush        | Barely a tool, can't be material-repaired, move from anvil to workbench
     - Deal with RepairItemRecipe somehow: delete, modify, blacklist, etc
     - Deal with Grindstome somehow:
     - Figure out how to work with armor
         - Will need a custom ArmorMaterial
         - May want both chain & non-chain variants of armor? Unsure. Would be up to 7 armor types tho...
         - Crafting recipes should include leather/fabric; less for non-leather armors
         - May want to degrade protection down towards 50% or so with more minor damage. definitely not zero at low tho.
         - Want slowdowns from some armors? Minor but can be resolved with less protection? Some other benefit?
         - Currently, chain basically doesn't have a use, that's not great...
 - Enchanting system
     - Books stacked; used for journals as well as normal books
     - Refactor enchanting power to depend on a much larger library & actual accessibility system
     - Bias enchantments via journals of skill (invested levels)
     - Other things like Anvil can use the library system to decrease costs
 - prevent the player from breaking blocks without tools
     - possibly use Player#blockActionRestricted & restrict to hardness 0.3 or under broken w/o tool?
     - would need to add tools for beacon, piston head (?) (axe?), honeycomb (axe?), frosted ice (pick?), cactus (axe?), glowstone (pick?)
     - Would need exceptions for some tool-less blocks (eggs, heads?)
     - Can use PlayerEvent.BreakSpeed event as it is cancellable
 - flour & some minor food tweaks
     - FD compat: rice flour, dough from them for bread, etc
     - other mod compat maybe?
     - create flour in the crafting grid for now?
 - less important/strange hardness tweaks for some blocks
     - Drop coral/dead coral down to match other similar stones?
     - Bump colored concrete to match theoretical final concrete? 1.5/10?
     - Bump glazed terracotta up to normal terracotta?
     - possibly reduce cake hardness to 0.2 or 0.3? unsure...
     - possibly increase bed hardness from 0.2? unsure...
 - Crafting tweaks to mudbrick? Add literal mud bricks?
 - finish updating torch tweaks
     - later game, torches can be crafted in the workbench with a lot of sticks, some wool, and a bucket of creosote/coal tar
     - if I ever add soul oil, soul torches can be crafted via the same method as 4 but with soul oil
 - add damage to some more blocks that should have it?
     - stonecutter
 - fix mob UI of the issue of walking into shit (?)
     - needs to be coupled with the above to make sure villagers don't suicide themselves
 - explosive tweaks to TNT and the addition of gunpowder placement/gunpowder barrels
     - Port gunpowder barrels from IE to GS
     - add in lines of gunpowder being able to trigger barrels/TNT
     - change the name of TNT perhaps?
 - crates (?)
 - Weatherproofed Planks/wood/etc
