 - Compost pile features
     - Possibly change recipe maps for composting recipes?
     - Possibly a compost crafting recipe (dirt + total 1 compost chance)
 - Sluice
     - Rightclick with water container in main hand and with block in the offhand
     - Possibly a special item for filling the sluice with water? Water bowl, plus SIN agrees. Water bowl used for crafting stews.
     - Two states for the sluice: empty & full. Full requires a rightclick with a shovel to remove sediment.
     - Have types for gravel at the top (guaranteed) and then choice of types for the bottom? Sand, red sand, mud?
     - Should I bother with custom recipes at all? Depends if I want to bother with custom output or not.
     - SIN suggests to put off a BER for now and to have it as a later, more complex feature

 - prevent the player from breaking blocks without tools
     - possibly use Player#blockActionRestricted & restrict to hardness 0.3 or under broken w/o tool?
