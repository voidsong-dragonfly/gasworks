 - Compost pile features
     - Possibly change recipe maps for composting recipes?
     - Possibly a compost crafting recipe (dirt + total 1 compost chance)
 - Sluice
     - Rightclick with water container in main hand and with block in the offhand
     - Possibly a special item for filling the sluice with water? Water bowl, plus SIN agrees. Water bowl used for crafting stews.
     - Two states for the sluice: empty & full. Full requires a rightclick with a shovel to remove sediment.
     - Have types for gravel at the top (guaranteed) and then choice of types for the bottom? Sand, red sand, mud?
     - Should I bother with custom recipes at all? Depends if I want to bother with custom output or not.
     - SIN suggests to put off a BER for now and to have it as a later, more complex feature

     - Machine shop 0
     - Crude Blast Furnace & bellows

 - possible features i might like from Suppl
     - Ash from burning blocks => decide if I want to entirely redo fire spread first
     - Quiver, Barometer & other useful tools
     - Useful small blocks; turntable, adjustable lever, & wind vane?

     - Map icons for portals, beacons, etc?
 - Tool system
     - Two kinds of durability, 'minor fixes' & 'major fixes'
 - Enchanting system
     - Books stacked; used for journals as well as normal books
     - Refactor enchanting power to depend on a much larger library & actual accessibility system
     - Bias enchantments via journals of skill (invested levels)
     - Other things like Anvil can use the library system to decrease costs
 - prevent the player from breaking blocks without tools
     - possibly use Player#blockActionRestricted & restrict to hardness 0.3 or under broken w/o tool?
     - Would need to move Daylight Detector & bed out of that cat. if so; possibly incr. hardness of tinted glass a little; possibly reduce hardness of cake
     - would need to add tools for beacon, piston head (?) (axe?), honeycomb (axe?), frosted ice (pick?), cactus (axe?), glowstone (pick?)
     - Would need exceptions for some tool-less blocks (eggs, heads?)
     - Can use PlayerEvent.BreakSpeed event as it is cancellable
