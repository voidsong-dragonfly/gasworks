# Gasworks Style Guide

Gasworks is a mod focused on late-Victorian technology, and its style closely follows that aesthetic. Gasworks focuses on semi-realistic processes and machines, tempered by the unrealistic nature of the base environment of Minecraft, and its style thus does not deviate appreciably from the expected Gaslamp Fantasy/Victorian Industry combination.

Gasworks is, however, not steam*punk* - it makes no political statements or commentary, and does not deal with the colonialism, imperialism, and rampant industrial exploitation that steampunk provides commentary on. If you're looking for steampunk, I suggest you go read *Fitzpatrick's War*.

Instead, Gasworks is retrofuturistic and set in an era when steam & steel were commonplace, spanning a roughly 120-year period between the 1800s and the 1920s. Barring simple technology, Gasworks technology begins roughly at 1800 with a predominance of water power and trip hammers, and proceeds forward to its final technologies before the 'breakway points' of electric arc furnaces, steam & mercury turbogenerators, and small internal combustion engines.

At the end of the mod, technology breaks way from the Earth equivalents and delves heavily into magitechnology, using the properties of novel Minecraft materials to produce exotic effects. In effec, the technology of Gasworks can be said to be that of 1920s engineer working forwards from fist principles to develop a technology base, and then exploring further. This effect is the cause of several 'ahistorical oddities' in the mod, including the presence of water-tube boilers across all technology.

## What makes something 'in the Gasworks style'?

The most important criterion is that the idea has to fit within the time constraints Gasworks operates under. Smartphones and cloning do not fit within Gasworks' time constraints, and thus are not in the Gasworks style.

Broadly, the Gasworks style can be distilled down to several key points:
 - Multiblock machines, no single 'magic' blocks
 - Realism-inspired technology achievable with low precision & simple tools
 - Interactive & visual components, preferably including player feedback and world effects
 - Broad choices of recipes, with speed through parallelization 

An additional point is that Gasworks explicitly chooses not to be in a pissing contest with other mods for who can make the most whingdangles per second or have the most floops per squeeble. Power creep has no hold here, Gasworks is balanced around Vanilla, itself, and a few select mods _only_. Comparisons to Mekanism, Thermal Expansion, or Industrial Foregoing will be ignored and will make whatever point you're trying to make less convincing, not more so.

## What is going to be rejected out of hand?

 0. Suggestions that compromise core gameplay elements, such as, but not limited to:
    1. Adding options to remove tweaks to Vanilla necessary for mod theming (including furnace separation)
    2. Allowing other mods to move molten metals or gaseous/vapor fluids
    3. Allowing fake players to use player-interaction blocks or items
 1. Anything similar to Industrial Foregoing, Just Dire Things, Thermal Expansion, etc
    1. Generic interaction machines, such as the Just Dire Things block placers or item users
    2. Machines that use tools and are not themselves the tools, such as the Just Dire Things block breakers
    3. Machine upgrades, such as Industrial Foregoing speed upgrades or Thermal Expansion augments
    4. Non-multiblock machines, such as literally everything in the mentioned mods
    5. Item pipes or other nonsensical forms of transport such as LaserIO nodes
    6. Yes, even that cool idea you have that you promise isn't too magic-block-y. Go play another mod.
 2. Vehicles or other entities. Too much work for too little gain.
 3. Ore 'multiplication'. Gasworks has a set amount of metal contained in a unit of ore, and will not exceed that amount. 
 4. More ores. Gasworks tries to be highly economical with its material provisioning, and would rather provide alloy steels and coppers than add in more ores with few uses. Thermal Expansion's three uses per ore is not good gameplay.
 5. Nuclear reactors. The uranium refinement chain and reactor production process have been  butchered by every mod under the sun already (yes, even by Mekanism). A similar system may be implemented, but it will not be fission-based.

## What kinds of suggestions are likely to be accepted?

Gasworks values suggestions with five characteristics, all five of which are necessary for best results:
> 1) Not on the list of unacceptable suggestions
> 2) Useful gameplay feature
> 3) Matches the Gasworks style
> 4) Can be visually interesting
> 5) Is viable to implement

These qualities should roughly be checked in the order they are presented in, with failing to satisfy one of these meaning that the suggestion or addon should be redesigned until it satisfies all of the constraints provided.

Ideas without much of a current basis are just that, _ideas_. They are not full suggestions, and are likely to be set aside. Coming up with ideas like "add a megatesla magnet to attract asteroids" is relatively simple - anyone can spitball hundreds of ideas per hour if they get going fast enough. Actually giving full suggestions with their ideas fleshed out and a good idea of mechanics, benefits, and rewards is much harder, but the more work put in, the better the results.

Taking a look at a suggestion from the Immersive Engineering Discord:
> Add a giant (megatesla) magnet to IE to attract iron-nickel bearing asteroids to be mined for resources

Let's disassemble this idea to see whether it's a good idea for Gasworks, going by each point.
1) This suggestion is _not_ on the no-implement list, so we're good there!
2) This suggestion does add a useful gameplay feature (ore collection), but it does not add a _new_ feature. Sometimes this can be ok, if it's a new specialty process or interesting, but this idea seems to be a worse Blasting Hammer. For now, this idea can pass, but it's on thin ice and needs something stellar to make up for being just ore collection agian.
3) Does this suggestion fit in the Gasworks style? Well, that's subjective, but let's pull a few words from the style:
    - Realism-inspired: While this suggestion seems to not use magic on the surface, how is this magnet going to be strong enough to attract asteroids but not also rip your machines off the ground? No-one has made a magnet this big or even this close IRL, either.
    - Retrofuturistic: Magnets, especially electromagnets, were coming out of the infancy of their study in the 1880s, and were established but still new technology in the 1920s. Magnet technology on this level is firmly out of reach of the mod.
    - Not futuristic: This sounds like the plot of a scifi C-movie flick where the central gimmick is the studio got an electromagnet for free from the scrapyard as their crane was decomissioned, It's very futuristic, more movie mad science than actual technology.
    - **Sub-Conclusion:**, this does _not_ fit the Gasworks style. Normally, we'd stop here, but let's see the whole list.
4) A large magnet could be made visually interesting, especially if a render for the colliding asteroid was made. The suggestion does pass on its visual merits, but it's not super stellar or anything. This does not make up for 2).
5) Making an asteroid render as well as a massive magnet model is a lot of work for what is essentially a different formulation of the excavator. It is viable to implement, but it is a lot of work for questionable gain.

Overall, we see that this idea is mediocre in many aspects, bad in several, and abjectly terrible in one or two. This suggestion would be rejected for its lack of use, inability to follow basic theming conventions, and minimal content.
## How can Suggestions/Addon Ideas be Improved?

Let's consider some guiding questions to follow for improving our suggestion:
> How much do you want to follow a realistic path for your suggestion?    
> How much of an idea do you have right now for it?

First, tackle if you have enough of an idea to really make a suggestion: If your idea isn't fully fleshed out, if the team couldn't reasonably implement a feature from it, consider adding more thought to it. Suggesting "rebalance the mineral veins to have more common resources" is fine, but a suggestion that gives _details_ on how to do that, such as what veins to change and how, and which materials need their percentages change? That is a lot easier to see the reasoning behin and implement.

If you're having trouble fleshing out your idea, go look at real life examples of similar ideas, preferably ones during Gasworks' rough time period (1800-1920) to get some inspiration. Lots of times the information is out there, just waiting for people to find it - lots of engineers tried incredibly dumb things you can learn from. If you're still looking for inspiration, posting in the discord will let people help you brainstorm, as will taking a look at functions Minecraft has that you could adapt into your suggestion to flesh it out fully.

Second, make sure your suggestion isn't unsuitable for IE in other ways. Semiconductors, fusion reactors, and lasers may look cool, but they're out of scope for a retrofuturistic mod. If your idea is too tightly entwined in ideas of the future, consider a solution that doesn't have a "futuristic" aesthetic but solves the same goal - replacing a fusion reactor with using heat exchangers in the Nether and a portal to pipe steam back to the overworld, or replacing semiconductor computing with new vacuum tubes or a miniaturized redstone contraption.

Third, make sure your suggestion isn't overbalanced or OP. Gasworks doesn't add some things like high-functioning singleblocks for a reason, and if your suggestion is in that category, it may be a good idea to step back and think if you really need all of this in only one block. Maybe it would be better to have your single-block tree cutting device be a saw multiblock closer to a Garden Cloche than a slab made of steel with a saw inside. Suggestions that start out overpowered or overbalanced are often the least likely to succeed, as often they're simply "feature but better".
