 BASIC MOD IDEA
------------------------------------------
Addon at the end of Gasworks which adds more interdimensional things, in the style of the Stargate idea but with several important changes.
Primary changes are Stargates requiring significant infrastructure to construct and, crucially, operate. No more 'tiny stargate platform on the surface', buried facilities and others are common.
Dialling is expensive enough to need dedicated facilities of either endgame (blaze tap power) or post-endgame (enriched naquadah reactor) but provides access to significant resources.
