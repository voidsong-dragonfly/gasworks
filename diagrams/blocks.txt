blocks to possibly include in Gasworks:

chiseled bricks for mossy. variants for mossy stone bricks, and possibly stone bricks as well.
chiseled bricks for purpur & endstone. cracked bricks for endstone.
chiseled bricks for red nether, prismarine, mud
smooth stone stairs.
move some of these blocks from the Gasworks tab to the Vanilla tab, perhaps?
