# How to Contribute to Gasworks

Gasworks accepts contributions given that they follow the guidelines below.    
Contributions not following the guidelines will be closed, often without comment.

## Is there a bug in the mod?
That's great! Please find the minimal set of mods that the bug happens with (preferably only Gasworks, if possible).

**Then:**
0. If the bug is with shaders, Optifine, or render mods, check to make sure there is not an issue on their GitHub first.
1. Check to make sure the bug has not already been reported. Use the search function, and try similar/synonymous terms!
2. Open an issue [here](https://github.com/voidsong-dragonfly/gasworks/issues)
3. Include your Gasworks version and a full debug log (Accessible via holding down F3+C for ten seconds)
4. Clearly state in the title, _without a version number_, a short description of the bug with Gasworks
5. Describe the bug in full in the issue body
6. Submit the issue

## Is this a suggestion for the mod?

That's great! Suggestions are unlikely to be accepted unless they fit with the mod, so to make sure the suggestion is likely to be accepted, follow the style guide found [here](https://github.com/voidsong-dragonfly/gasworks/STYLE_GUIDE.md) for best results. Once you've verified that the suggestion will be accepted, you may proceed.

**Then:**
1. Check to make sure the suggestion has not already been made. Use the search function, and try similar/synonymous terms!
2. Open an issue [here](https://github.com/voidsong-dragonfly/gasworks/issues)

## Do you have a Pull Request for more functionality?

That's great! Pull requests are a great way to quickly get features you're interested in integrated into the mod. However, pull requests are subject more stringently to the tenets of the style guide found [here](https://github.com/voidsong-dragonfly/gasworks/STYLE_GUIDE.md), due to the implementation being directly added to the mods. Once you've verified that the pull request will be accepted, you may proceed.

**Then:**
1. Open a pull request [here](https://github.com/voidsong-dragonfly/gasworks/pulls)
3. Clearly state in the title, _without a version number_, a short description of the summary of the PR
4. Describe the PR in full in the issue body, _including the reasoning behind the change_
